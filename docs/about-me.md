# About Me

## 👋 Background

Hello, how are you? 

My name is Kimberly Hopson and I'm a Senior Technical Writer. Thanks for visiting my page!

With over 8 years in the documentation field, I bring experience and versatility to the table.
I've dabbled in a variety of writing styles and formats, from technical editing and UI/UX writing
to content marketing and API documentation. I can also handle documentation-specific challenges
such as creating a review process or managing repositories.

Currently, I am a technical writer for **BlueGrace Logistics**.

Previously, I've written for large companies like **Blackhawk Network**, **Lucidworks**, **VMware**, **Johnson & Johnson**, and **Dell Boomi**.

Whether you're looking for user-friendly instructions or reference documents that won't make your head spin, I've got you covered.

Let's make your documentation shine!
