# About Me

## 👋 Background

Hello, how are you? 

My name is Kimberly Hopson and I'm a Senior Technical Writer. Thanks for visiting my page!

With over 9 years in the technical writing field, I bring experience and versatility to the table.
I've written a variety of documentation types, from how-tos and UI/UX writing
to video content, release notes, and API documentation. I also have experience planning documentation strategy and implementing new platforms.

Currently, I am a Technical Documentation Specialist at **ONEngine.ai**.

Previously, I've written documentation for companies like **Blackhawk Network**, **Lucidworks**, **VMware**, **Johnson & Johnson**, and **Dell Boomi**.

Whether you're looking for user-friendly instructions or reference documents that won't make your head spin, I've got you covered.

Let's make your documentation shine!
